**Project Description for E-commerce Sales Analysis**

**Context**  
This project involves analyzing a one-year dataset of sales transactions for a UK-based e-commerce business that sells gifts and homeware items through its online platform. E-commerce plays a vital role in business expansion, providing access to broader markets with lower distribution costs. This dataset captures the purchasing behavior of individual consumers as well as small businesses that buy items in bulk for resale. The dataset helps explore customer purchasing patterns, sales trends, and profitability to offer strategic insights for business growth.

**Dataset Content**  
The dataset consists of 500,000 rows and 8 columns, each representing a transaction record with the following attributes:

1. **TransactionNo**: A unique six-digit code that identifies each transaction. The presence of "C" in the code indicates a cancellation.
2. **Date**: The date the transaction occurred.
3. **ProductNo**: A unique five or six-digit identifier for each product.
4. **Product**: The name of the product.
5. **Price**: The unit price of each product, in pounds (£).
6. **Quantity**: The number of units purchased in the transaction. Negative values represent canceled transactions.
7. **CustomerNo**: A unique five-digit code for each customer.
8. **Country**: The country of the customer’s residence.

Occasional order cancellations are included, usually due to stock issues.

**Business Questions**  
The analysis aims to address the following key business questions:

1. **Sales Trend**: What patterns can be identified in sales over the months?
2. **Frequently Purchased Products**: Which products are most popular among customers?
3. **Transaction Quantity**: What is the average number of items purchased per transaction?
4. **Customer Profitability**: Which customer segments are the most profitable?
5. **Strategic Recommendations**: Based on the data insights, what strategies could be recommended to enhance profitability?

**Objective**  
The goal of this project is to use SQL to analyze the dataset and generate actionable insights, providing strategic recommendations to improve customer engagement and profitability in the e-commerce business.
